More specifically, when an Enigma operator presses on a key, an electrical signal passes through a complex web of wiring, controlled by the plugboard and rotor, which leads to one of the letters on the lampboard to flash. \n",

        "2. **Walzenlage = Rotor Type and Order**: Operators had 5 different rotors to choose from and could place them in any order. Each rotor had it's own unique wiring and turning point. \n",
        "3. **Ringstellung = Ring Setting:** Each rottor had a ring setting which would offset it's wiring relative to the alphabet. For example [A, B, C] -> [F, H, D] mapping shifted by 2 ring settings would become [A, B, C] -> [H, J, F]. As you can see, each encoding shifted 2 places up in the Alphabet. \n",
        "4. **Steckerverbindungen = Plugboard:** Before a letter passes through the rotors, it is first swapped by another letter, a mapping that is explicitly set by the operator. For example, if A is \"steckered\" to B, when an operator clicked on A, the electrical signal would pass through the usual B path, and vice versa.\n",
        "5. **Kenngruppen = Date Discriminant**: To specify which date's Enigma setting a sender was using, they would send the date discriminant as morse code over radio.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once an operator configures their Enigma for the day, they would be ready to both send and recieve messages. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the step-by-step for sending a message with the Enigma:\n",
        "1. Operator thinks of 3 letters at random, which will be used as the Grundtellung or initial rotor position of the 3 rotors. E.g. [F, E, G] can be used as the initial positions. \n",
        "2. Operator thinks of another 3 random letters which would be used for the message-setting. These letters would then be typed into the Enigma, and the outputs would be written down. The rotor positions would then be turned to the new 3 letters. E.g [A, B, C] -> [F, E, G] -> [Z, X, W]\n",
        "3. The intended message would then be typed into the Enigma with the new settings. Over radio transmission in morse code, standard information, the Kenngruppe discriminant and the Grundstellung would be broadcasted without encryption. The second part of the message would include the enciphered message-setting with the full enciphered message. \n",
        "\n",
        "Next, here's the step-by-step for deciphering an Enigma message:\n",
        "1. Operator would use the Grundstellung rotor position to first decipher the enciphered message-setting (in our example, it is [Z, X, W]), which would output the necessary rotor position to decipher the rest of the message (which would be [A, B, C])\n",
        "2. After setting the rotor positions to the message-setting, the operator then types in the rest of the message, which is returned as plaintext on the lampboard. \n",

The rotor is fully initialized once the `load_config` function is called, in which the ring setting, rotor position, and final core position is set. The main logic behind the `position` property is that core position of the rotor is offset by the difference in positions between the ring setting and rotor position. E.g. if a rotor has an initial position of G and the ring setting is 2, the total offset from the original wiring would be the index of G in the alphabet (which is 4) minus the ring setting, which would be 2. \n",

In these methods we see the `position` property comes into play; we offset the input pin by adding the position value to it. The new offseted pin input then indexes the wiring lists that were initialized with the rotor. The pin output from the wiring list is then offset once again by the `position` parameter, this time subtracting the value from the pin output. The `wiring_inverse` is the reverse of the original rotor mappings, which is used for outward letter translations. \n",
